## HDB Resale Price Analysis (2016â€“2021) â€” Tableau Dashboard Storytelling

### Objective

This project was developed as part of the "Data Analytics for Design" course and focuses on leveraging Tableau to explore and visualize resale HDB flat prices in Singapore from 2016 to 2021. The primary objective is to **transform raw data into a meaningful and interactive narrative** that can inform decision-making for various stakeholders.

---

### Problem Statement

**Big Question**:
How have resale HDB prices evolved in Singapore from 2016 to 2021, and what trends can we identify to inform buyers, sellers, and policymakers?

**Small Questions**:

* Which towns show the highest increase or decrease in resale prices?
* How do flat types (e.g., 3-room, 5-room) affect price trends?
* Are there seasonal patterns or consistent pricing trends over the years?
* Which towns offer the most affordable housing options?

---

### Target Audience

* **Potential homebuyers** looking for affordable and high-value options
* **HDB and government policy planners** seeking to monitor housing trends
* **Property analysts and real estate agents** aiming to understand market dynamics

---

### Project Deliverables

* `Assignment2.twbx`: Tableau Packaged Workbook containing interactive dashboards and visual storytelling
* `Resale HDB 2016-2021.xlsx`: Cleaned dataset used in the project

---

### ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Features

The dashboards include:

* Interactive filters by **town**, **flat type**, and **year**
* Annotated charts for key price trends and outliers
* Tooltips and highlight actions for user-friendly exploration
* A **Tableau Story** combining visual dashboards into a cohesive narrative

---

### Key Insights

* **Central and mature estates** (e.g., Bishan, Queenstown) consistently show higher resale prices.
* **Executive flats** generally have the highest median resale values across years.
* A **gradual price rise** is evident post-2018, possibly linked to economic recovery and market confidence.
* **Jurong West** and **Woodlands** remain among the more affordable options, making them attractive to first-time buyers.
